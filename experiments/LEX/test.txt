Dear Ingrid Neuhaeuser,
    
    It's very kind of you to send me the reminder mail. I'm so sorry that I will not be able to attend the meeting due to the busy schedule. According to the reminder mail, the only feasible solution is to withdraw my paper(#19). 
    I'm terribly sorry for the inconveniences caused.Trust me, I am not doing this on purpose.
